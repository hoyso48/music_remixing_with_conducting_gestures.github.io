Music remixing is increasingly being commercialized through the integration of AI-based source separation technologies. The advantage of music remixing using source separation is that it allows users to creatively recompose any music they want, even if they are not the original composer or do not possess the project's files.

## Demo Video

# Design

The screen is divided into appropriate regions, and the separated stems are mapped to these regions. Users can manipulate individual stems through conducting gestures in these regions.

## Gestures

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### How to use

```
git clone https://github.com/hoyso48/music_remixing_with_conducting_gestures.github.io.git
cd source
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
All you need to do is run the above commands and specify the audio file path(mp3, wav, flac) you want to remix. It will takes a few minutes to preprocess the audio file when you load the audio file for the first time.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
